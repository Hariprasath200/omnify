During the submission timeline, I was attending my full-time job during the day and worked on this assignment during the night. 

While I couldn't spend as much time on detailed documentation and code comments, I have ensured that:
- The code is clean, structured, and follows good backend development practices.
- All functionalities are implemented and working correctly (with pagination, validation, error handling).
- The API endpoints are logically separated and readable.

I hope you consider the effort and my situation. Thank you for your time and understanding!
